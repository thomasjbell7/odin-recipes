# odin-recipes

This is the first project I've completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Full instructions explaining the project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

The main aim of the project was to develop a multi-page HTML only website.
